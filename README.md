# jargonLint

The repository to find popular Vale rules that are:
- **Comprehensive:**  Exhaustively prepared from reliable sources
- **Easy to Implement:** Tested and well-documented
- **Permissively Licensed:** MIT compatible licensing

## Vale

[Vale](https://vale.sh/) is an open source documentation software, accessible both from the [command-line](https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/) or through [integrations](https://vale.sh/docs/integrations/guide/). An important advantage of the software is its capability to support custom [styles](https://vale.sh/docs/topics/styles/) and [lint actions](https://vale.sh/docs/topics/actions/).

Many organizations that use Vale, sincluding [Red Hat](https://github.com/redhat-documentation/vale-at-red-hat) and [Splunk](https://github.com/splunk/vale-splunk-style-guide), often publish their configurations with permissive licenses. The repositories with these rulesets can be very useful to learn and adapt from. However, they also reveal that many documentation writers have re-iterated upon similar rules delivering the same results.

## Our Contribution

We wanted to build upon commonly listed rules in the hopes that a non-affiliated repository could host exhaustive lists that everyone could adopt. This could significantly reduce the redundant work that each organization has to complete. Furthermore, it could substantially decrease the burden of maintenance if a trusted central repository could host files while receiving fixes from everyone.

We plan to build more comprehensive rules by:
1. Expanding upon primary sources rather than create arbitrary lists.
2. Combining pre-existing work that can be easily accessed and categorized.
3. Improving the applicability of certain pre-existing rules so that everyone can benefit from them.
