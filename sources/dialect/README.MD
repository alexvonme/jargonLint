# Dialect Support

This rule has not yet been added.
For now, we have only added some files and sources.
This section will gradually be expanded as the rule is written.

The files inside ``original_files`` were added from the version 1 tree of the original repository, [``en-wl/wordlist``](https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist/tree/v1).
